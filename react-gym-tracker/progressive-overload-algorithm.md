# Progressive overload recommendations based on the User's previous sessions

- algorithm values long term gains not week over week gains
- Automatic recommended progression by increasing weight and/or reps for an exercise
- Feedback from User adjusts the algorithm's calculations
    -  Start of the session -> Ask the User how sore each muscle to be trained in today's session is on a scale of 1-5 (Measures how well the User has recovered from the previous same session)
    -  After each set -> Ask the User how many reps in reserve was achieved for that set (Measures how hard the User is working to reach the weight/reps target)

"Artificial intelligence allows fitness apps to dynamically adapt workouts based on real-time data and user feedback. By integrating with wearable devices, such as heart rate monitors or fitness trackers, AI algorithms can continuously analyze user performance metrics during workouts. This data can be used to adjust exercise intensity, duration, or rest intervals to optimize the user's training experience. For example, if a user's heart rate indicates fatigue or if they are consistently surpassing their performance targets, the AI algorithm can modify subsequent workouts to prevent plateauing and ensure ongoing progress."
